#Service Level Agreement#

##What on earth are we talking about?##

What we refer to as waiting time (WT) is the time between us receiving your support request and the time that a live person gets back to you with a view to estimating the amount of time required and scheduling the work.

What we refer to as response time (RT) is the time between us receiving your support request and the time for which work commences on the support request.

What we refer to as the service level window (SLW) is the time during which somebody will be manning the support desk ready to respond to support requests. Waiting and Response time can not advance outside this period.

What we refer to as a working day (WD) is a time unit comprising 8 hours of SLW time and may span multiple calendar days

##Support request closure##

A support request will be considered to be closed under one of the following conditions.

1. We supply a workaround, information that resolves the issue or carry out work and you agree that the issue is resolved.
1. You have not responded 10WD after a workaround or information is provided.
1. You have not responded 10WD after additional information has been requested.

In cases 2 and 3 above, we will follow up with you on or around 5WD and you will receive notification when the ticket is resolved

##Out-of-hours Support##

It is possible to arrange for support outside the service level window defined in the SLA. 

While we will endeavour to accommodate any request, such support cannot be guaranteed and must be pre-arranged and agreed via email by a representative of Pie Web Limited.

Out of hours support will be charged at 2 x rate for Additional Ad-hoc Hours as defined in your contract, under the same payment terms and detailed separately on any invoice. Out of hours support will not form part of the included Ad-hoc Support Hours.
